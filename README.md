# IPL Data Analysis and Prediction using AI Agents

This project focuses on analyzing IPL data for **2023** using **Gemini-powered AI agents**. The analysis utilizes AI agents to clean, explore, and visualize data, and make predictions about match outcomes for IPL 2023.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to leverage **AI agents** for automating data science workflows, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling. The analysis aims to uncover key insights from IPL match data and predict match outcomes using machine learning models.

### Inside the Notebook  
- **AI Agent Setup**: Integrated Gemini AI within Colab for conversational automation.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, standardized formats, and filtered relevant columns.  
- **EDA**: Explored win distributions, seasonal team trends, and match outcome patterns.  
- **Modeling**: Built and evaluated classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVC) to predict IPL 2023 outcomes.  
- **Visualization**: Auto-generated plots such as win distribution by team and box plots of runs vs outcomes.  
- **Insight Generation**: Agent provided narrative summaries and key observations about influential match features.

### Highlights  
- Full pipeline completed via AI prompts â€” no manual scripting required.  
- Visualized historical performance trends and patterns across teams.  
- Prediction models trained to estimate match winners based on historical stats.  
- AI agent surfaced insightful features (e.g., first innings wickets) and explained performance gaps.  

## Technologies Used
- **Google Colab**
- **Gemini AI Agent**
