# IPL Data Analysis and Prediction using AI Agents

This project focuses on analyzing IPL data for **2023** using **Gemini-powered AI agents**. The analysis utilizes AI agents to clean, explore, and visualize data, and make predictions about match outcomes for IPL 2023.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to leverage **AI agents** for automating data science workflows, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling. The analysis aims to uncover key insights from IPL match data and predict match outcomes using machine learning models.

## Contents

### 1. **Python Notebook:**
- **AI Agent Integration:** Code for utilizing AI agents to automate data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building and evaluating machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVC) to predict IPL 2023 outcomes.
- **AI Agent Insights:** Visualizations and insights automatically generated by the AI agent.

### 2. **Cleaned Data:**
- Preprocessed and cleaned dataset for use in modeling and visualizations.

### 3. **Visualizations (visualizations/):**
- Key visualizations generated by AI agents, including:
  - Distribution of match wins by team.
  - Trends over seasons for different teams.
  - Box plots showing the relationship between total runs and match outcomes.

### 4. **AI Agent Insights:**
- Key insights generated automatically by the AI agent, including performance trends, match predictions, and data visualizations.


## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Data Cleaning & EDA:** AI agents performed data preprocessing, handled missing values, and created insightful visualizations.
- **Trend Analysis:** Visualized team performance trends over seasons and match outcomes across different parameters.
- **Prediction Models:** Developed predictive models to forecast the **IPL 2023 winner** using machine learning algorithms.
- **Automated Visualizations:** The AI agent automatically generated relevant plots like the **win distribution by team** and **wickets vs. outcomes**.
- **Data Insights:** AI agent-generated insights like the **impact of wickets** taken by the first batting team and **venue-specific analysis**.
