# IPL Data Analysis and Prediction using AI Agents

This project focuses on analyzing IPL data for **2023** using **Gemini-powered AI agents**. The analysis utilizes AI agents to clean, explore, and visualize data, and make predictions about match outcomes for IPL 2023.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to leverage **AI agents** for automating data science workflows, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling. The analysis aims to uncover key insights from IPL match data and predict match outcomes using machine learning models.

## Contents

1. **Python Notebook (`ipl_agent_analysis.ipynb`)**  
   - **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and standardized key fields  
   - **Feature Engineering**: Created match-level aggregates and encoded labels  
   - **EDA**: Visualized team trends, win distributions, and outcome correlations  
   - **Modeling**: Trained and evaluated Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVC models  
   - **AI Agent Interaction**: Iterative prompting to improve results and generate plots

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Data Cleaning & EDA:** AI agents performed data preprocessing, handled missing values, and created insightful visualizations.
- **Trend Analysis:** Visualized team performance trends over seasons and match outcomes across different parameters.
- **Prediction Models:** Developed predictive models to forecast the **IPL 2023 winner** using machine learning algorithms.
- **Automated Visualizations:** The AI agent automatically generated relevant plots like the **win distribution by team** and **wickets vs. outcomes**.
- **Data Insights:** AI agent-generated insights like the **impact of wickets** taken by the first batting team and **venue-specific analysis**.
